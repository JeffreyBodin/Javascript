See ManateeRawr's post from yesterday:

```https://www.reddit.com/r/donaldtrump/comments/jfl0b2/watch_party_president_trump_holds_make_america/```

```/watch_party_president_trump_holds_make_america/```

```https://i.imgur.com/tFQR7M5.png```


As you can see the title is:
```WATCH PARTY: President Trump Holds Make America Great Again Rally in Gastonia, NC 10/21/20```


Only:

```watch_party_president_trump_holds_make_america```

This string ^. Is found in the actual url.

That, is not enough to get us everywhere within basic search indexing.

If something, *just*, indexes the plaintext. And, doesn't go n+ into the page itself. 

Ie if you have adblock on or something like me. 

Or, data saver on Android, ie believe default for most everyone. 

Who doesn't have dev.

So, its fairly likely that we will miss quiet a bit of "outside" traffic. If we can get ourselves posted into any external social media feeds.

Like say... any white house officer's "personal" twitter, etc.

Then when searching for **their** name. Twitter being one of the highest priorities on Google. 

We, as a recent tweet. Would appear. 

And, then an end user, would not necessarily have to have any "deeper" indexing. 

Ie **go** to Reddit itself and load it on the backend. To just optimize for search results. 

This drives immense traffic to *us*, as /r/DonaldTrump. First instead of the YouTube link.

Ergo, it drives traffic to *Reddit*. Hence why its favored in their own algorithms. 

And, can be relied on to still be in effect. As, its such a huge driver of income. 

And, it cannot actually to my knowledge be changed fully in Reddit's backend. 

To disallow all end Redditors. The ability to essentially "design" their own top lvl domain perma-link. 

(Through the titling of their post)
